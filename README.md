Hitting Set Attack Algorithm in Mix Networks (C++)


Hitting Set Attack [1] is one of the powerful exact attack to de-anonymize users in Mix Networks.
Complexity of algorithm is np-complete therefore running time is drawback for large scenarios.
Here you can find a serial and parallel version of the codes of attack algorithm simulation.
